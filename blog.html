          <h2>Pixels vs. Relative Units in CSS</h2>
          <p>In my opinion, using relative units is better, because of the following reasons:-</p>
          <ul><li>If you set the font size in pixels in your CSS (that includes base font size), the end user will not have control over their browsing experience should they choose to change their default font size setting in the browser.</li>
        <li>The page may zoom, however the fonts will not scale up relatively to the browser default font size setting. Therefore, the end user experience is being impacted by the developer’s choice to use pixels for fonts.</li>
    <li>
        Those three scenarios will make the page layout identically:
        <ol><li>font-size set in browser settings to 32px; the page uses relative units for everything.</li>
        <li>font-size set in browser settings to 24px, page zoom set to 133%; the page uses relative units for everything.</li>
    <li>font-size left at the default 16px, page zoom set to 200%; the page uses pixels for everything.</li></ol>
    That would mean the main disadvantage of using pixels is the user won’t start with the desired element & text sizes from the start if they set the browser-level font-size and they’ll have to zoom in the page first (unless they set the default page zoom in Chrome instead; then it works out of the box). After the first visit the browser will already remember the set page zoom.</li>    
    </ul>

          <h2>16px is default browser font-size so what does it mean when we say 200px ?</h2>
          <p>If we do not set font size, by default html font-size is 16px.
              But we set the font size to 200px while we develop the html, then the browser take it as 100% font size.
          </p>
          <h2>How does the browser interpret that ? </h2>
          <p>when we say the default width of the browser is 16px, we mean that its intial 100% width is 16px. And also when we say 200px, we mean that the default 16px will be changed to 200px.Its all for calculation purpose.
            it simply means changing 100%=16px into 100%=200px. And if someone wants to use the zoom settings in the browser menu to make text larger or minimize, then the browser consider 200px default to zoom or minimize.</p>

          <h2>Specific Changes In CSS3 </h2>
          <p>CSS3 version introduced new features that allowed developers to style HTML elements with less CSS code. CSS3 is most notorious for modules that speed up the specification process.</p>
        <h3>Overview of New Features</h3>
        <h4>Box Shadow</h4>
        <p>One of the CSS3 new features is the box-shadow property that adds a shadow to an element. Instead of using multiple images around an item, this property lets you add shadow with a short line of code.</p>
      <h4>Opacity</h4> 
      <p>One of the CSS3 properties called opacity makes elements see-through or completely transparent.

        For instance, you can apply opacity to images or other HTML elements. The transparency level depends on the indicated values.</p> 
      <h4>Rounded Corners</h4>
      <p>Before the release of CSS3, developers had to write long code to produce rounded corners. Now, it is enough to apply the border-radius CSS3 property to HTML elements.</p>
    <h4>Attribute Selectors</h4>
    <p>CSS3 also introduced new selectors in addition to the ones in CSS2. Instead of applying IDs or classes for styling, developers can select HTML elements according to their attributes.

      As a result, you do not have to create unique IDs only to apply CSS rules.</p>  
    <h4>New Colors</h4>
    <p>One of the CSS3 features is the addition of new colors:</p>
    <ul><li>
      RGBA</li>
    <li>HSL</li>
    <li>HSLA</li>
     <li> Gradient Colors
    </li></ul>
    <h4>More than Web-Safe Fonts</h4>
    <p>Instead of only using fonts labeled as web-safe, developers now can apply more unique fonts in their HTML documents. Before that, CSS wanted to ensure that all browsers and machines display fonts the same.</p>
  <h3>CSS3 Features: Useful Tips</h3>  
  <ul><li>
    CSS3 supports responsive designs and manages media queries (used for determining users' devices and screen sizes).
  </li>
<li>
  Since CSS3 new features let you produce fewer lines of code, you can boost the website speed.
</li>
<li>Since CSS3, CSS animations move without JavaScript or Flash code.</li></ul>
